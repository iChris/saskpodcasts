## What is this?

It's just a list of podcasts created in [Saskatchewan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saskatoon), [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada).

## Why?

I really like projects the web that can be easily linked to, updated, changed, and passed on to someone else if I get bored.

## Who are you?

I'm [Chris Enns](https://chrisenns.com/), a [podcast editor / producer](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/), who wants to help listeners find more podcasts to listen to.

## Isn't there already a Saskatchewan Podcast Network?

Yep! Go [check it out](https://saskpodcastnetwork.com/) and sign up if you're interested.

The main difference, aside from a clever mic shaped as the province logo (v. nice!), is I don't care if you ever link back to this list or not. I'm not trying to help you sell ads or get sponsors. This is purely a list of podcasts made in Saskatchewan.

## Where is it hosted?

At present the public facing site is at [saskpodcasts.netlify.com/](https://saskpodcasts.netlify.com/).

The site is hosted on [Netlify](http://netlify.com/). The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/iChris/saskpodcasts).

## How can I help with the site?

Feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/iChris/saskpodcasts/issues) (*i.e. there's something wrong with the information on the site*) or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/iChris/saskpodcasts/pulls) to add a new podcast to the listing.
